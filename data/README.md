Convolutional Neural Network library

This is a simple library that alows to easily create, train and test
CNN architectures. The library is meant for educational purposes and
is writtern for clarity - not for speed.

This library was tested with two datasets:
- The MNIST dataset of handwritten digits
- A subsection of the FER-MASTIF TS2010 Croatian traffic signs dataset

Pretrain models are available in ./models. You can test them by calling
testMASTIF_TS2010.py or testMNIST.py.

If you're going to learn a network by yourself (learn*.py) have in mind
that it's very slow.
